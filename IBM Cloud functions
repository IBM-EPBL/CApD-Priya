IBM cloud functions
-------
These are function as a service ,based on apache whisk ,they created polygot Function as a service
Uisng IBM Cloud functions you can create or develop lightweight,scalable code on demand 
This is also serverless model and you are going to pay for what you are using(no of requests ,memory and excexcution time taken for request) 


IBM Cloud functions features
-----
`1.Open mindded ecosystem - anuyone can contributre for building blocks
2.Simple and quickier development 
3.It can be easily integrate with cognitive services like IBM wartson for your workflows 
4.pay for what you use


use cases where IBM cloud functions are used
--------
1.Serverless web application
2.Mobile applicatoin wiyh serverless backend
