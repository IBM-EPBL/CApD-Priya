Data -collection of disticnt small unit of information - text,numbers,media

Database - organized collection of data that can easily managed an accessed

Evolution of database
-------
1.filebased storage - flat file 
advantages
------
indexing ,sequential ,random 

2.hierarchial data model
-------
parent -child manner
 root - folder 1 - subfolder 1
        folder 2 -subfolder 2,subfolder 2
		folder 3 - subfolder 5 ,subfoler 6
		
advantage
---
storing data in hierarchial manner

disadvantage
-------
it is hierarchial no structural format 
cant handle many to many relationship

3.Network model
------
Charles Bachman in 1970 ,forts kind of DBMS at Honey well


4.Relationship model(RDBMS)
---------
Relations (tables - rows and columns)



5. Cloud based database (or) database as a service
-------
it faciliates easy storage ,manage and retrivee structure and unstructured data via internet.
It as database as a service 
IBM Cloud databaes will host the database on their cloud .All the services will be managed by  the cloud provider

Advanatages
------
1.Lower cost - No headache of having servers to run database,no miantennace cost , no staff to manage ,no need if think of power or internet payments or bills
2. Automate resources s(failover,recovery strategy ,autoscaling)
3.Increased accessibility(from anywhere any time,internet connectivity)

SQL - Structured query Language
NOSQL - Not only SQL

SQL                                NOSQL
----                               -----
1.Database categorized as RDBMS    1.Non Relational ,hierarchial,distributed or graph based
2.Fixed schema                      2.Dynamic schema 
Eg:product atble                     Eg :product tables
productid,product desc,              product code 
product avaialbility
3.Displays data in form of         3.Display data as key value pair(Dynamo db),document based(json),graph based(nodes,edges) ,timestream based - AWS Timstream 
table so this is table 
based database
4.vertical scalable                4.Horizontanl scaling(increasing nuber of instances)
(RAM,Mmeory)
5.Structired query language )       5.ubstructured query language .From database to database it varies
define or manipulate data
6.Complex queries                   6.Not good for complex queries they do not have sql queries
7.Hierarchial data storage          7.Hierarchial storage

Mysql,Oracle,Microsoft sql server,  Mongo,document,redis,Neo4j,Dynamo db,IBM Cloudant
